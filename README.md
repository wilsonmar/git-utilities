You can't always git what you want
You can't always git what you want
But if you try sometimes
You just might find
You git what you need

This GitHub repository contains files used by and explained in Wilson Mar's
Git and GitHub course.

There are two editions of scripts in this repo:

* File names ending in <strong>.ps1</strong> are PowerShell scripts that run on Windows,
but now also Mac and Linux machines after installing <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/powershell-on-mac/">Microsoft's PowerShell on OSX</a>.

* File names ending in <strong>.sh</strong> are Bash scripts that normally run on Mac,
and now also on Windows machines installed with <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/bash-windows/">Microsoft's WSL (Windows Subystem for Linux)</a>.
Such scripts are being phased out in favor of a PowerShell script for use by all.

Learners make use of two sets of scripts that issue <strong>git commands</strong>
so you can experiment to see what happens when you make a change to commands.

<hr />

<strong>mac-git-install.sh</strong> automatically installs and configures all you need to work with git professionally. It downloads and installs xcode, homebrew, git, code completion, GPG to enable code signing. Sublime and Microsoft's Code editors are installed.
It configures .bash_profile by adding in contents of the <tt>mac-bash-profile.txt</tt> file containing keyboard aliases. It configures your .gitconfig with color.ui and code signing after it generates GPG and SSH keys for pasting into GitHub or other repositories.
Version numbers are output for each utility installed.
If something is already installed, that is skipped. So this script can be run again.
Begin by changing file <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsonmar/git-utilities/blob/master/.secrets.sh">.secrets.sh</a> with your own information.

<strong>git-hooks-install.ps1</strong> should be run after cloning locally
to install scripts that Git invokes automatically based on events.
A git clone is necessary to re-build the database.

<strong>git-sisters-update.ps1</strong> is a PowerShell script that
clones a sample sample repository you forked on GitHub.
It calls a script that sets git configurations for a project (or globally)<br />
<strong>git_client-config.ps1</strong>

<strong>git-sample-repo-create.ps1</strong> is a PowerShell script that
creates a repository on your local clones your fork of a sample sample repository.

All these scripts create a folder, but that folder is deleted at the beginning of each run
to make them "idempotent" in that each run of the script ends up in the same condition,
whether run the first time or subsequent times.

The scripts contain an <strong>exit</strong> after each set of steps
so you can examine the impact of the whole sequence of commands.

Additionally, diagrams (animated step-by-step in PowerPoint) have been prepared to illustrate the flow and sequence of commands.

Enjoy!
